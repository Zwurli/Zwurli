I have developed a device with which it is now possible to dry filament effectively during the printing process (Inline-Dryer, Dry on the Fly...) I call it the Flowdryer.
Filament is guided over an air-permeable wheel and warm air flows around it in a chamber in a sophisticated circular path.
The entry and exit of the filament are designed in such a way that the device can be loaded very easily.
Thanks to the carefully developed geometry of the carrier wheel, the filament is reliably guided in a smooth position without becoming tangled.
This means that the resistance of the system is extremely low; every extruder is able to pull the filament through the device.
The Flowdryer's wheel can temporarily store up to 4 meters of filament. This results in a dwell time for the filament in the device that is always sufficient to ensure effective drying.
After printing has ended, any filament remaining in the FlowDryer can easily be wound back onto the spool, so there is no filament wasted.
